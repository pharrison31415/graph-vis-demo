## Run

Run ` main.py` with one system argument, the path to a graph data file.
eg:
`$ python main.py data1.txt`

## Graph Data Grammar

The file is split into two sections separated by a blank line. In the first section, each line is a unique identifier (uid) for a new vertex. In the second section, each line has two vertex uid's, separated by a space. See `data1.txt`.
